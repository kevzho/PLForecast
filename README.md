# PLForecast - Premier League Prediction Dashboard (WIP)

- Predicts the probability that each Premier League team will win the league
- Updates live using match results / standings
- Visualizes model outputs (e.g., probabilities, rankings, expected points)
- Uses machine learning or Monte-Carlo simulation
- Runs locally or deploys via Streamlit Cloud

### Sources: 
1. https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php
2. https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/premier-league/table


### Data that was collected:
#### From each match:
- Home team, Away team
- Score
- xG (Expected Goals)
- Possession, shots, cards
- Match date
- (Optional, will maybe include) Betting odds

#### From each team: 
- Current standings
- Form (Last 5 wins)
- SPI Standings (If we can access)
